In this hw02, we will take use the [LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial Notebook](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial) 
and companion files that are publicly available on Github. In addition, we will structure this repository as a reproducible research package, 
with installable utilities separated into a small Python package, a conda Environment specification and a new Binder link.
